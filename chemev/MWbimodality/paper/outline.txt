* The old metal-rich population 
	- Static-disk models w/linear KS relation 
		- Reproduced for O for tau_star as high as 2 Gyr 
		- Reproduced for Fe for tau_star < 1-1.5 Gyr 
	- Static-disk models w/non-linear KS relation 
		- Same as the linear KS relation case, except effect is less 
			pronounced for O; looks like tau_star larger than 2 shouldn't have 
			an old metal-rich population in O 
	- Inside-out models w/non-linear KS relation 
		- Not reproduced for Fe in any model 
		- Reproduced for O in models w/tau_star shorter than 1.5 Gyr 
	- Inside-out models w/linear KS relation 
		- Same as with the non-linear KS relation 
	- Easier to reproduce old metal-rich population in static disk models due 
		to ongoing star formation producing more young stars in the solar 
		neighborhood 
	- Bottom-line result: models suggest <2 Gyr star formation timescale at 
		early epochs and small radii within Milky Way disk, or else this 
		observed result is not reproduced 

* The young alpha-rich population (or young Fe-poor population) 
	- Seen in all models 
	- Result of deficit in number of SN Ia events at large radii, leading to 
		intrinsically iron poor ISM 
	- Note that our interpretation is not mutually exclusive with that of 
		Silva-Aguirre et al. (2018) - they're explanation stems from stellar 
		interactions, which are not captured in our models. Absolutely 
		possible that both are true for portions of the population 

* z-dependent MDF (3-panel) (could do with age as well) 

* Bimodality in [O/Fe] at constant [Fe/H] 
	- Static disk models w/linear KS relation 
		- Seen in all models 
		- Becomes more pronounced with shorter tau_star 
	- Static disk models w/non-linear KS relation 
		- Struggle to reproduce this 
		- Subtle yet noticeable in some metallicity bins 
			- More apparent for linear-then-exponential SFHs 
	- Inside-out models w/non-linear KS relation 
		- Struggle to reproduce this 
	- Inside-out models w/linear KS relation 
		- Reproduce this result well for tau_star = 0.5 and 1 Gyr

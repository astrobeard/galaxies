We investigate the impact of stellar migration on galactic chemical evolution 
models, considering a handful of assumptions for the star formation history 
and time-dependence of radial migration based on a zoom-in, hydrodynamical 
simulation of galaxy evolution. When stars migrate with a smooth, continuous 
time dependence, the type Ia supernova rate exhibits significant variability in 
our models. We demonstrate that this is a means with which young, super-solar 
[$\alpha$/Fe] in the solar neighbourhood can arise naturally out of inside-out 
Galaxy growth with stellar migration. We find 
that the observed age-[$\alpha$/Fe] relation is well-fit by an inside-out star 
formation history, while the age-[$\alpha$/H] and age-[Fe/H] relations are 
well-fit by a late starburst model; no one model investigated here fits both 
simultaneously. Our model successfully reproduces the broad nature of the 
[$\alpha$/Fe] distribution at fixed [Fe/H] in a given Galactic region; however, 
an overprediction of the frequency of intermediate [$\alpha$/Fe] stars prevents 
it from explaining the observed results in detail. This suggests 
that inside-out galaxy growth combined with stellar migration, even with a late 
starburst, is not conducive to forming the infamous bimodality as it is 
observed. We postulate that more dramatic evolutionary scenarios (e.g. a 
two-infall model) may be necessary to describe the observed results. In 
conducting this analysis, we developed and made use of newly released features 
in the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE) 
which are built to handle these models under a wide variety of 
assumptions. VICE is publicly available 
at https://pypi.org/project/vice.
